NEW ENTITY FEATURE: CUSTOM VALUES
Certain entities now have 6 custom values they can use! Every new entity tells you in this file what their custom value(s) do, so there's no need to worry about what does what thing.

#361 -> Booster Refill
Refills the players Booster Fuel when touched. If Alt Direction is set, then it will set your fuel to 0.

Custom Values available:
01 - How much fuel is given when touched (Default is 50 if set to 0)
02 - How many frames until it respawns (Default is 150 if set to 0)
03 - The position of the sprite in the spritesheet. Works like <MIM -- Setting it to 1 will move the sprite 16px down.

#362 -> Lock-On Trigger
Homes in towards the player in both X/Y directions.

Custom Values available:

01 - How fast the trigger is. (Default is 1535 if set to 0)
02 - The Top Left X coordinate of the RECT (Default is 0 if set to 0)
03 - The Top Left Y coordinate of the RECT (Default is 0 if set to 0)
04 - The Bottom Right X coordinate of the RECT (Default is 16 if set to 0)
05 - The Bottom Right Y coordinate of the RECT (Default is 16 if set to 0)
06 - The Surface the npc uses (Default is the one set in npc.tbl if its set to 0)

#363 -> 2-Way Trigger
Runs entity event X when going inside the trigger from 1 direction, and runs entity event X + 10 if coming from the other.

#364 -> Player Matcher
Matches the players position on spawn then deletes itself, unless it has alt direction, in which case it always matches the players position every frame it's active.

#365 -> Backstep Trigger
Forces the player to be bumped backwards in the opposite direction, an invisible barrier of sorts. Same as <MYB.

#366 -> Kill Trigger
Forces the player to explode upon impact, no matter their HP or I-Frames.

#367 -> Forced Booster (Horizontal)
Forces the player to boost hozizontally even if they dont have a booster, with no means of stopping. By default it goes left, Alt Direction makes it go right.

Custom Values available:
01 - How much fuel the forced boost has (Default is 50 if set to 0)
02 - How long until this forced boost respawns (Default is 50 if set to 0)
03 - The position of the sprite in the spritesheet. Works like <MIM -- Setting it to 1 will move the sprite 16px down.

#368 -> Forced Booster (Vertical)
Forces the player to boost vertically even if they dont have a booster, with no means of stopping. By default it goes up, Alt Direction makes it go down.

Custom Values available:
01 - How much fuel the forced boost has (Default is 50 if set to 0)
02 - How long until this forced boost respawns (Default is 50 if set to 0)
03 - The position of the sprite in the spritesheet. Works like <MIM -- Setting it to 1 will move the sprite 16px down.

Sets the flags assigned to the custom values available. When given the "Unused / Custom" checkbox, it unsets the flag IDs instead.

#370 -> Purple Critter (Upside Down)
Labyrinth Critter enemy that has reversed gravity.

#371 -> Camera Target
Focuses the camera on the entity within a set radius, and unfocuses the camera when leaving the radius. The radius is roughly 5 tiles out on both the X and Y axis.
Using <ANP to set the entity to state 1 will delete the entity and set the cameras focus back to the player.

Custom Values available:
01 - Radius on the X axis in tiles to focus the camera.
02 - Radius on the Y axis in tiles to focus the camera.

02 - The event in the destination map to run.
03 - The X coordinate to spawn at in the destination map.
