	<h1>TSC+ COMMAND DOCUMENTATION</h1>

	<p>
		This help file provides some information about the 
		commands included in TSC+. TSC+ as currently released in BL
		has 3 parts: the base commands, commands added by the PHYS
		addon, and commands added by the TIMG addon. To use PHYS or TIMG requires
		applying base TSC+ first. TSC+ is a large hack, so it doesn't usually
		play well with non-TSC+ TSC modifications.
	</p>
	<h2>TSC+ BASE:</h2>
	<hr>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;LRXXXXX:YYYY:ZZZZ<br>
	Wait for a keypress and run either event X, Y, or Z
	depending on whether they key was Left, Right or Shoot
	<p>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;FNJXXXX:YYYY<br>
	Jump to Y if flag X is not set.
	<p>
	
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;VARXXXX:YYYY<br>
	Puts YYYY into variable # XXXX
	</p>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;VAOXXXX$YYYY<br>
	Performs operation $ on XXXX using # YYYY. Valid values of $ are + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) and % (Basically IDIV). Dividing by zero will crash the game, by the way.
	</p>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;VAZXXXX:YYYY<br>
	Zeros YYYY variables, starting at variable # XXXX. &lt;VAZXXXX:0000 will do nothing.
	</p>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;VAJXXXX:YYYY:ZZZZ:WWWW
	Compare XXXX to YYYY using method ZZZZ, if true jump to WWWW. ZZZZ is as follows:
	<table>
		<tr><td>0000</td><td>X is equal to Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0001</td><td>X is not equal to Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0002</td><td>X is greater than Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0003</td><td>X is less than Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0004</td><td>X is greater or equal to Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0005</td><td>X is less or equal to Y</td></tr>
		<tr><td>0006</td><td>Always jumps, but that's a bug in the code. Any higher than 6 and you may very well crash the game.</td></tr>
	</table>
	does NOT assume arguments are variables. Use VXXX if you want to access them here.
	</p>
	
	<p class="code">
	&lt;RNDXXXX:YYYY:ZZZZ
	Puts random # between XXXX (min) and YYYY (max) into variable ZZZZ.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Other changes: <br>
		<br>
		VAR utilizes flags 6000-8000. Variables numbered V008-V123 can be used
		safely. Variables higher than 123 will begin modifying other RAM values
		- you can use this to your advantage if you know the math. VAR flags 
		start at address 49E090. Each var is two bytes.
		<br><br>
		For any TSC argument, if the first digit is replaced with "V"
		then it will be evaluated as Variable #XXX. Example:
		<p class="code">
			&lt;FAI0004 // fades in with direction "4"<br>
			&lt;FAIV010 // fades in using the value of variable 10
		</p>
		&lt;NUMXXXX now outputs the value in variable XXXX to the message box.<br>
		As well, certain variables are pre-populated and should not be set.
		These are "read-only" meaning changing them will not do anything.

	<h2>TSC+ TIMG ADDON:</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="code">
		&lt;IMGFILE<br>
		will set TimgFILE.bmp over the screen. The "tag" for
		the file name must be exactly 4 characters. <br>
		&lt;IMG0000 will remove the image overlay.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pure black [00000000] in the overlay image will be transparent.
		This replaces the "Blackboard" npc (043) and "Grate" npc (100)
	</p>
	
	<h2>TSC+ PHYS ADDON:</h2>
	<hr>
	<pre class="code">
	Command &lt;PHYXXXX:YYYY	Type:Value
Physics variables that can be changed:
	0 = Max Walk Speed (normal 812)
	1 = Max Fall speed (normal 1535)
	2 = Gravity (normal 80)
	3 = Alt Gravity (normal 32)
	4 = Walk Accel (normal 85)
	5 = Jump Control (normal 32)
	6 = Friction (normal 51)
	7 = Jump force (normal 1280)
	8 = 0 but water
	9 = 1 but water
	10 = 2 but water
	11 = 3 but water
	12 = 4 but water
	13 = 5 but water
	14 = 6 but water
	15 = 7 but water
	16 : water doesn't cause splash
		or trigger air timer.
		
	</pre>
	<p>
		When using the PHYS hack, you need to define ALL your physics
		variables whenever a new game is started, otherwise the player will not
		move. PHYS uses flags starting at 49E060.<br><br>
		You can then change physics using TSC whenever you want. DO NOT use
		the regular hackinator physics hack in combination with this one!!
		it will break!!!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Max movement speed is defined by 01:MaxFallSpeed 
	instead of hardcoded now</p>
